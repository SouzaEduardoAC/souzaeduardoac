### Hi there, :wave:

My name is Eduardo and I'm a senior developer engineer from Brazil, currently working at Ambev Tech.

Aside from coding, I write about everything I study or work with at my [blog](http://souzaeduardoac.github.io/blog).

I have 5+ years of experience as a developer.

I usually spend my free time with hobbies such as taekwondo, calisthenics, traveling and cooking.

Currently working on creating a product/company of my own. @martial-arts-coolabs
