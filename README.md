### Hi there, :wave:

My name is Eduardo and I'm a senior developer engineer from Brazil, currently working at Ambev Tech.

I have 8+ years of experience as a developer.

I usually spend my free time with hobbies such as taekwondo, calisthenics, traveling and cooking.

Currently working on creating a product/company of my own, focused on supporting and giving autonomy to developers through software.
